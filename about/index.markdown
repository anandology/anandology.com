# About Me


Hi, I'm Anand Chitipothu. I live in Bangalore, India.

I'm very passionate about prorgamming and building stuff.

I've authored [web.py][] and [Infogami][] with [Aaron Swartz][sw], built [Open Library][ol] at the [Internet Archive][ia], created a machine learning platform at Rorodata, trained hundreds of engineers through his deep-dive courses at [Pipal Academy][pipal].
