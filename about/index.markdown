# About Me


Hi, I'm Anand Chitipothu. I live in Bangalore, India.

I'm very passionate about computer programming. I've programmed in about  dozon programming languages. Python is my preferred language of choice, but Go lang seems to be taking some of my attention these days.

I've authored [web.py][] and [Infogami][] with [Aaron Swartz][sw], built [Open Library][ol] at the [Internet Archive][ia] and currently building [rorodata][], a startup a recently co-founded.

I conduct advanced programming courses through [Pipal Academy][pipal].

You can contact me at
