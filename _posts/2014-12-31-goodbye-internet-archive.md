Today is my last working day at the Internet Archive.

Its been close to 8 years since I joined the Archive. I've enjoyed and learnt
great deal while working there.

Its been quite time some since I've taken off from work for a long stretch and
had time for my self. I've been longing for such a break and I'm very happy
that day has come.

Even though I'm moving away from the archive, its vision of universal access
to all knowledge continues to insipire me.

Good bye Internet Archive!
