I'm offering a [one-day training course][doattend] on Python
programming on Sunday, June 03, 2012.

This will cover the basics of Python programming language, enough to
get started on small projects.

No prior Python experience is expected. Experience with programming in
some language will be helpful.

This will be a hands on session. The participants will solve lot of
exercises during the course. The participant should bring their own laptops.

This is targeted at students of various engineering colleges. Others
are welcome too.

**Venue**: 

[The Center for Internet and Society][cis]    
No. 194, Second 'C' Cross,     
Domlur 2nd Stage,     
Bangalore - 560071

**Date**: Sunday, June 03, 2012

**Time**: 9:00 AM - 6:00 PM (includes one hour lunch break)

**Logistics:**

Lunch is **not** included in the fee. The participants have to make
their own arrangements for lunch. There are good restaurants around
the venue, so it shouldn't be a big issue.

A nominal fee is charged to cover the logistics costs. 

The seats are limited.
