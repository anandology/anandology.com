Today, in memory of [Aaron Swartz][aaron], I'm introducing [Archive Pages][apages], a little tool to let you host websites for your archives on the Internet Archive.

[Internet Archive][ia] is wonderful institution. It more-or-less provides infinite storage and infinite bandwidth for public data forever for free.

However, it is hard to host a website on the Internet Archive. What if you have a nice website for an archive that you've hosted on the Archive? What if you want to restore a lost website from the Wayback Machine? Woundn't it be nice to host the website also on the Internet Archive along with your archives?

With Archive Pages, you can now add a file `archive-pages.zip` to your archive.org item with all contents of the website and the website will be live at `itemid.onarchive.org`.

Think of it as [Github Pages][ghpages] for the [Internet Archive][ia].

Sounds interesting?
